Bank marketing website

- Project
  CK Banking is a project I created after learning basic DOM manipulation. This website was the perfect way to improve my understanding and use more advanced techniques to create a responsive, modern looking website.

Besides this, I wanted to make sure it would be a website I would enjoy visiting, meaning it had to be visually pleasing.

- Problems and Thought Process
  Making sure to implement page nav slow scrolling with event delegation for efficiency, using e.target on a parent element; rather than attaching the same event handler to multiple elements. Using the intersection observer API for the sticky navigation, section reveals and lazy loading images instead of adding event listeners to the window itself for optimization purposes.
